Got it 👍. Let me briefly explain how to make your GitHub profile look professional (based on the steps in your screenshot):

Steps to Create and Improve Your GitHub Profile
Create a Profile Repository

Go to GitHub → New Repository.

Name it exactly the same as your GitHub username.

Example: if your username is rajdeepdas, the repo should be rajdeepdas.

Make it public and check “Add a README file”.

Add README Content

The README.md file will be shown on your GitHub profile.

Write an introduction about yourself (skills, interests, goals).

You can use an AI README generator or write manually.

Customize and Refine

Add sections like:

👋 About Me

💻 Skills & Tools

🚀 Projects

📫 How to reach me

Use Markdown for styling (headers, bullet points, links, badges, emojis).

Enhance Project READMEs

For each project repo, improve the README.md:

What the project does

How to install/run

Features

Screenshots or demos

Showcase Projects

Pin your top 6 repositories on your profile (important/impactful ones).

Maintain & Update

Regularly update your profile README and project READMEs.

Add new skills, certifications, and projects as you grow.

✨ Tip: You can add GitHub stats cards, contribution graphs, and dynamic badges to make your profile more attractive.

Would you like me to make a sample professional README.md template for your GitHub profile that you can directly use?

In making of same user name repository what to write in the description space as per"https://github.com/RajdeepDas012"
ChatGPT said:
Good question 👍

When you create a profile repository with the same name as your username (RajdeepDas012), the description is optional — but it shows up right under your name on your GitHub profile, so it’s good to write something short and professional.

Since your repos show you’re into fun web projects, simple games, and AI experiments, here are some good description ideas you can use:

Options for Your Repo Description
✨ Showcasing my projects, experiments, and learning journey in coding and AI

🚀 Personal GitHub profile of Rajdeep Das | Web Dev • Games • AI

💻 Portfolio of my projects: from web animations to AI pipelines

🌱 Learning and building with JavaScript, Python, and AI tools

👨‍💻 Developer • Problem Solver • Always Learning

👉 My recommendation for you (based on your repos):

🚀 Portfolio of my projects: Web Dev • Games • AI experiments

This is short, professional, and tells visitors what they’ll find.

Do you want me to also suggest a professional tagline (bio) that appears just below your name on your GitHub profile (separate from repo description)?
